## Project: Fun with Functions

This project involves forking and cloning a GitHub repo, and then creating solutions to some code problems such that my solutions pass the included tests

- Create a new branch for each code problem, and merge each branch into master on GitHub (and then pull back into master on your laptop!) when the problem is completed

- Place no function calls in your code, unless inside of another function. Everything should be run by hand from the console
