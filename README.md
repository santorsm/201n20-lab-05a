## Project: Fun with Functions

This project involves forking and cloning a GitHub repo, and then creating solutions to some code problems such that my solutions pass the included tests

- Create a new branch for each code problem, and merge each branch into master on GitHub (and then pull back into master on your laptop!) when the problem is completed

- Place no function calls in your code, unless inside of another function. Everything should be run by hand from the console

- I watched the live code review prior to completion; did not reference after watching

## Reflections and Comments

- Found it challenging to wrap my head around the parameter we were passing the arguments through conceptually
  - I got myself all confused on a bunch of minutae
- Watching the code review really helped me to gain a better understanding
- Time-boxing made a difference, just have to remember to keep the timer volume lower
- I do appreciate the stepped approach to introducing these items
- Although I know we're going to get plenty of practice, this GitHub branching etc is still a bit uncomfortable
  - I created a checklist of the steps to this point; we'll see how good my checklist dicipling is!
